# {Energy Usage Dashboard} (Group A)

The dashboard created based on a dataset that was collected to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building. It also includes the temperature and humidity of different rooms in the building. We would like to see if the energy usage has difference in different condition (time, temperature, humidity and so on) and give advice to the engineer to design the low energy building and the customers who want to save energy in their daily life.

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{We are interested in how to save energy and whether the energy consumption is effected by the factors such as temperature and humidity. The dashboard would like to show the energy consumption condition and the user can know how to lower their energy consumption by controlling the factors. }

Ideally, you'd include a 5-7 second gif of your final dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

* The data set was donated in the year 2017 by Luis Candanedo, University of Mons (UMONS). The data was collected to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building.
* Each appliance in the house were attached with a sensor node and the temperature and the humidity was recorded every 3.3 minutes. The average of these temperature was recorded for every 10 minutes.
* The data was collected in the year 2016, January 11th to May 27th.
* The outside temperatures were also recorded to check the appliances energy use in low energy buildings.
* The data was divided into training and testing set to perform regression models to reduce the MSE of the model to predict the energy use by an appliance.
