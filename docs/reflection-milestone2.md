*For milestone 2, we have created the framework and base components of our dashboard to examine factors impacting energy and temperature of a European house through the year.*

# Features Implemented
Our dashboard is spread across a sidebar and 2 tabs of content.

### Sidebar

* Sidebar updates dynamically in place based on selected tab.
* Dropdown 'compare' values in sidebar update based on the data being used in that tap.
* Multiselect 'include' values in sidebar update dynamically based on the Dropdown 'compare' values selected.
* 'Timescale' radio select features options to aggregate the data to see patterns in time-groups.

### Tab 1

### Tab 2
* Energy use visualization created (statically).
* Time series visualization with dropdown integration for variable selection.

# Features Not Yet Implemented

* App styling and formatting not yet tidied and formalized. This is still a rough draft, not a final product.
* Tab 1 Visualizations not yet included in final app.
* Tab 2 Visualizations not yet linked dynamically to sidebar selections with callbacks.
* "Date Range" selection not yet implemented in sidebar to filter data -- we removed it from this version.
