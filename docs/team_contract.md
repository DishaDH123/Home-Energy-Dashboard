# Team Working Contract

This is a contract between the team members of group A for the project that will be done for Data551 (Data Visualization 2) in University of British Columbia, for the Master in Data Science program.

## Team Members

| Name     | GitHub Handle                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Disha DH | [@DishaDH123](https://github.com/DishaDH123) |

| Kristy Phipps | [@klphipps](https://github.com/klphipps) |
| Yilin Sun | [@ysun822](https://github.com/ysun822) |

## Participation

All team members agree to fully participate in all aspects of the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. Action 1. Open, regular communication between all team members 
2. Action 2. Clear delegation of tasks and workload
3. Action 3. Everyone agrees to meet as scheduled to and to follow internal deadlines
4. Action 4. Support and in each others unique skillsets (lead, follow and show as approprite)
5. Action 5. Each agrees to give to give our best effort

## Communication

All team members agree to communicate openly and transparently during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. Action 1. Always agree to know when we will be meeting as a group next
2. Action 2. If we are falling behind in our individual efforts, that must be communicated to the group ASAP
3. Action 3. If urgent help required, will slack with "Urgent!" otherwise approx 24 hr turnaround
4. Action 4. All communications will be respectful (written or in person)
5. Action 5. All major pull requests will be shared with group on slack

## Meetings

All team members agree to meet regularly during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete ideas that we all agree to regarding scheduling and frequency of meetings:

1. Idea 1. Will always schedule next group meeting at conclusion of current meeting
2. Idea 2. Will decide as a group whether in person or virtual is desired for next meeting
3. Idea 3. We will meet at least weekly during lab time on Wednesdays, more if required
4. Idea 4. Will try to be efficient with our meeting and keep to the tasks at hand
5. Idea 5. Will all try to attend meetings, but its okay if there is a scheduling conflict

## Conduct

The code of conduct we have chosen is in the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.
All team members agree to following the code of conduct, and below are five concrete escalation steps that we all agree to follow in the event that the code of conduct is violated by any member of the group (Step 1 is the first thing you will do, and Step 5 is the last thing you will do).

1. Step 1. Handling the violate part and undo it 
2. Step 2. Talk to the student who violate the code of conduct (one on one)
3. Step 3. Talk in the group about the violation
4. Step 4. Meet and talk to the TA
5. Step 5. Talk to the professor


## Conflict Management

Despite our best intentions, conflict may invariably arise within teammates.
Discuss amongst your team some conflict mitigation strategies (feel free to search online if needed) and come up with 5 strategies all members of the team agree to follow in the event there is a conflict within the group.
You may also include things you will NOT do in the event a conflict arises.

1. Strategy 1. Talk to your teammate and try to solve the conflict peacefully. 
2. Strategy 2. Follow the conduct regulation(talk to the person,TA and professor)
3. Strategy 3. Control your own feelings and be in a peaceful mind when meeting the conflicts. 
4. Strategy 4. Be respectful to others and don't hurt others feelings.  
5. Strategy 5. Don't ignore the issues

## Deadlines

All team members agree to the following conventions around course deadlines:

1. Doing our best to not do things in the last minute.
2. Having realtively even distribution of work load.
3. Collectively work together and support each other to make sure deadlines are being met.

## Git Workflow

All team members agree to the Feature Branching] workflow, and the following conventions (e.g., master branch protection, at least 1 review before a pull request):

* Git Feature Branch Workflow
    * We will create new branches off of main for different features of the app (layout components, data pipeline, architecture, etc)
    * We will make commits frequently with commit messages onto these branches describing the contents of our work.
    * When we reach reasonable sized checkpoints of "ready" work, we will create pull requests.
    * We will review each other's pull requests, provide feedback, or pull in the request if approved as needed.

* The `main` branch should be clean, predictable, and functional code. 
    * Pull-requests should not be approved if code harms functionality of the `main` branch.
    * Unless minimal or for a good reason, changes should not be made directly to the `main` branch.

## Addendum: Final Reflection on Workload Distribution

** This section should be completed AFTER Milestone 4 is done and submitted! Only one is needed PER group. **

In this section we will ask you to self-report the workload distribution to various categories of tasks.
For each of the categories, we want you to report the approximate workload distribution, split by the milestone.

Here are the tables you are expected to complete (the first one is pre-filled in so you can see what we're expecting):

### Milestone 1

| Category           | Disha         | Gavin         | Kristy        | Yilin         |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Repository Setup   | -             | 100%          | -             | -             |
| Sketch             | 25%           | 75%           | -             | -             |
| Documentation      | 20%           | 25%           | 30%           | 25%           |

Brief notes/explanations (optional):
- The Bulk of the work in this milestone is contained in "Documentation".
- Repository Setup was in preparation for Milestone 2, not milestone 1.
- No code troubleshooting was needed for milestone 1 documentation - only some small git explanations.

Brief notes/explanations (optional):
- Yilin was responsible 80% of the repository setup for the R application, and Disha for 20%.
- Gavin contributed much less in Milestone 3 after taking the lead on milestone 2.
