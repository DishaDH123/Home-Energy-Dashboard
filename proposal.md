Potential Research Questions:

potential fig 1 - Which factors make a difference to house temperature? (line plot?):
* Does sunlight (eg. east vs west) make a meaningful difference to room temperature? Humidity?
* Does floor-of-house (eg. ground or second floor) make a meaningful difference to room temperature? Humidity?
* Does Daytime / Nightime make a meaningful difference to room temperature? Humidity?
* Does the type of the room (bedroom, kitchen) make a meaningful difference to room temperature? Humidity?

potential fig 2 - which climate factors make an impact on energy usage? (maybe barplots for lights and appliances and home):
* Does time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) make an impact to energy usage?
* Does day of week (weekday, weekend) make an impact to energy usage?
* Does outside humidity make an impact to energy usage?
* Does outside temperature make an impact to energy usage?
